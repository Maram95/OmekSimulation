# OMEK SIMULATION

This project intends to provide a research platform for PointCloud Lidar simulation as part of
consortium Magnet "Omek".
The project allows researchers to produce pointclouds simulating movement of a platform
(e.g. rover, drone, plane) with a Lidar in a 3D world.
The simulator produces the pointcloud according to a set of parameters (i.e., resolution, range
and accuracy).
Using the simulator pointclouds with the same scenario (platform, world, path) with various
parameters (i.e., resolution, range and accuracy), one can check the ability of suggested
algorithms to cope errors, low-resolution.
